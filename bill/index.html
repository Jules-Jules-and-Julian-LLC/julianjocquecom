Hey Bill<br/>
I had a lot of fun playing the RF/EM instrument together briefly before the new year.<br/>
Sorry I tripped and fell.<br/><br/>
I had a fun idea for a cute little game though!<br/>
The idea is that you kinda unlock access to my world (the public bit is <a href="https://www.julianjocque.com/">here and it gets kinda personal</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First.
<br/><br/>
A few caveats. <br>
<ol>
    <li>I'll preface that I genuinely just had a lot of fun making this little tech stack to follow my static HTML first design philosophy, and it made for a good excuse to look over your catalogue and what not. If you prefer to just chat over email, it's always open julianjocque@gmail.com, and I'll see you on questions.html regardless.</li>
    <li>This is just between us. No bots are here. No crawlers. I haven't told anyone this corner exists, and until you do, it's us.</li>
    <li>I am respecting your privacy and likeness at as many layers as is technically feasible. (more on that later)</li>
    <li>This isn't some freaky deaky flip ya on your head oh no now you gotta deal with me when I'm on the proverbial literal edge again. I'm proud of who I was when we first interacted. I'm more proud of who I am now.</li>
    <li>This first bit is just Javascript. You can check the source and solve it if you like, but it's an easy one.</li>
    <li>Each subsequent layer will be met with extremely clear details on exactly what interactions are possible, and the lengths at which I am taking to keep this secure, just you and me, whichever of the yous and mes show up is fine.</li>
    <li><b>Consent is paramount.</b> This is a separate point because at no point in this will you suddenly be thrown into an interaction. You clicked a link and now you're on an HTML page with no tracking, no spying, no side channels (it's hosted on Cloudflare, I turned off logging what not in anticipation of this).</li>
    <li>Haaaave fun with it!</li>
</ol>
Anywhoodles, first lil game. It's a word scramble, there's exactly one answer, capitalization counts. Wordserdserds order doesn't.<br/><br/>
<form onsubmit="checkGuess(event)">
    What oh what wordswordswords could this becomecomecomecome?<br/>
    <img src="../assets/scarmble.png"/><br/>
    (I've never made one of these and moving the little letters on screen was fun. I tried to do it in my head but yeesh, there were tricky letters (for me))<br/>
    <input type="text" id="guess">
    <input type="submit">
</form>

<script>
    let count = 0;
    const input = document.getElementById('guess');

    const checkGuess = function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        const split = input.value.split(" ");
        const correct = split.includes("Professional") && split.includes("Princess") && split.includes("Programmer");
        if (correct) {
            const judgement = count === 0 ? "Damnit, too easy" : count <= 5 ? "gj" : count <= 10 ? "aight" : "effort is a reward in itself";
            alert(judgement);
            document.getElementById("goNext").style.display = "block";
        } else {
            count++;
        }
    };

</script>
<br/>
<i>Unlimited tries, no processor penalty for incorrect guesses. Correct guesses are met with a clear consent to continue to the next decision and what that decision is.</i><br/>
<br/><br/>
<form id="goNext" onsubmit="window.location.href='./bill/textChallenge.html'; return false;" style="display: none">
    Hope you fancied the warm-up.<br/>

    <h2>Next Step - Synchronous Text Chat</h2>
    I've written a few other emails before deciding this was what I wanted as a hey howdy doody. It's extra. Not as extra as the emails I wrote, believe it or not.<br/>
    If you are interested, you may click continue below to be given another challenge to earn access to secure, private, synchronous text chat with only me.<br/>

    I may be out to lunch. You'll know before you join.<br/>
