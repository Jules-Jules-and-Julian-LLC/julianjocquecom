        <figcaption>Britty, the last photo I have of him (and only one on hand) was the only cat my family ever adopted from the shelter rather than from our own fostering. This is after he was handed off to my then girlfriend, he and Hazel did not get along, and he was spraying urine around the house, my dad was going to euthanize him, I sent him to Anastasia instead.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Sage. She was born in my sister's closet, the first batch we had and she was born with chronic pain. She was the first cat that ever purred for me and the closest I've been to anything other than a human. She was fiercely intelligent, an incredible hunter, and aged with beauty and grace. Her death was shattering for my mother.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Hazel was found off the streets of Detroit at about age 1.5. She was very very difficult to get attuned to human life but was the best mother I've ever seen. She took on two separate litters that were not her own and raised them right. Seeing her go from nothing but thorns and claw to begging for belly rubs taught me patience.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>A momentary ceasefire. Sage and Hazel did not get along. We got Sage, then Britty (who were in love love then just got along okay) then Hazel and Moxie was Hazels' first kin along with Daisy who was a sister that turned out to be a brother (trans??)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Moxie, the last to last. He was very anxious from loving other cats but getting endless head bops from Sage. My dad would shout out, "Hey Moxie!" and they'd do their night time attic routine. My father lives by routine, he is a routine.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>My sister is a librarian through and through, to this day she has digital notes of every single fostered cat (over 100). It's on one of those "backwhentheinternetwasgood.com/putyourcatshere.html" websites that I think is still running somewhere. This is from a photobook she made. One photo was missing of a cat on next door Homosexual neighbor Jason's back but I can still remember it for it being the singular time he entered our home. A childhood of infinite kittens was blessed beyond belief.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>My most recent fascination, Griselda was still getting accustomed to her new space in Anti Cruelty (7 minute walk from me in 77 West Huron), and gone by the time I returned. I am approved to foster, or was, but I let it lapse because I went insane.</figcaption>
