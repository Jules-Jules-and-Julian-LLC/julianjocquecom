<h1>Everybody Needs a Break Sometimes</h1>
Inspired by this photograph<br/>

<br/><br/><br/>
He burns with thought,<br/>
a venerable stone building<br/>
&#9;frames him.<br/><br/>
He’s paid to play pretend<br/>
but the cigarette butts &amp; unkempt street<br/>
&#9;are real now.<br/><br/>
His fight scene<br/>
&#9;had gone wrong.<br/><br/>
He was to dodge the left hook, sweep the leg.<br/>
But the enemy didn’t jump the sweep,<br/>
&#9;&amp; down he went.<br/><br/>
Face met flowery tea cup,<br/>
cutting a thick, deep gash,<br/>
&#9;a spray of blood.<br/><br/>
His enemy knew what should have happened.<br/>
But he did it,<br/>
&#9;he made leg crash into leg.<br/><br/>
The closed eyes, broken face<br/>
&#9;won’t leave him.<br/><br/>
"Jackie, you’re on."
<h1><b>The Book of the Hacker (Desire)</b></h1>
<i>Live as if you were digital.</i><br/>
Inspired by The Book of the Dead Man by Marvin Bell
<br/><br/><br/>
<b>1. About the Hacker and Desire</b><br/>
The hacker does not know where he finds himself.<br/>
On one of his morning exploits, he sees writing in a foreign tongue that<br/>
reminds him of Russian, but sharper.<br/>
The hacker finds himself in The Ukraine, he stares blankly at his green on<br/>
black terminal; his window into that much larger than him.<br/>
The hacker stands in a river of information.<br/>
He finds an open webcam and sees a newborn baby, eyes twinkling in the light of the LCD.<br/>
The hacker now sits at the top of a financial empire in the heart of Wall Street.<br/>
Now the hacker reads an email about a graphic car crash, picture included.<br/>
He is briefly in the memory banks of the people he intrudes on.<br/>
The hacker wonders how long he will remember his acquaintances.<br/>
An annoying accident finds the hacker at his own server.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<b>2. More About the Hacker and Desire</b><br/>
The hacker has no family, he doesn&#39;t need one.<br/>
He abuses the follies of man and machine.<br/>
The hacker is excited over the idea that his curiosity may be boundless.<br/>
He dons a hat of healthy grey.<br/>
For the hacker, a simple command can ripple out into the physical world.<br/>
To the hacker, the internet is a sticky copper spiderweb.<br/>
To the hacker, data is the oil, the blood, the gold.<br/>
To the hacker, the transistor is the basic unit of life.<br/>
The hacker yearns for dense cityscapes and lively coffee shops.<br/>
The hacker thinks of the shoulders he stands on: Alan Turing, Dennis Ritchie, Ada Lovelace, GeoHot, Solo, C0mrade, TeaMp0isoN and wants others on his.<br/>
The hacker is proud of his shrouded work.<br/>
The hacker has seen technologies come and go just as he has seen people, policies, regimes and parties come and go.
<h1>Chinese Fall</h1>
Inspired by Tomas Tranströmer
<br/><br/><br/>
The rose with a single thorn,<br/>
intentionally untrimmed,<br/>
bites the victim.<br/>
Their wince is candy.<br/><br/>
Shining Chinese gorge, between<br/>
Wu Shan and Ba Dong.<br/>
In the distance,<br/>
a roiling thunderstorm<br/>
narrows its eyes.<br/><br/>
Organ, with endlessly complex pipes,<br/>
smooth ivory keys.<br/>
Hides itself from the listener,<br/>
shows only false, hollow exterior.<br/>
Blares loud, cacophonous Messiaen chords.<br/><br/>
Burs in my brother&#39;s shoes,<br/>
hours of incessant itching<br/>
will show him.<br/>
How dare he<br/>
take my Pokemon cards.<br/><br/>
<h1>This Poem Is Not About Cara</h1>
The whore cries,<br/>
“I&#39;m your little bitch”<br/>
in that whiny, grating,<br/>
“I&#39;m about to fake<br/>
an orgasm” squeal I&#39;ve<br/>
heard a hundred times<br/>
before, but never from<br/>
this side of the<br/>
bedroom door.<br/><br/>
Fuck...<br/>
Fucking Fucking Fuckity Fuck!<br/>
Blinded by tears and screaming<br/>
along at 60 miles an hour,<br/>
I&#39;m going home to my bed.<br/>
For a month, the world had ended.<br/>
It felt like my pores<br/>
oozed black slime.<br/><br/>
I finally let myself go out<br/>
to a bar, and mope at<br/>
anyone that would listen.<br/>
“Hey buddy, that sucks.<br/>
Let me buy you a beer.”<br/>
We talk about our ex girlfriends<br/>
and he knows the feeling all too well.<br/>
The night goes on, and<br/>
I&#39;ve made a friend.
<h1>"Friday I&#39;m in Love"</h1>
is that song from high school<br/>
I never want to hear again and<br/>
Anastasia is the girl who gave it to me.<br/>
Her parents fled cold, careless<br/>
Putin when she was 8.<br/>
Our love came quickly.<br/>
At the choir camp bonfire<br/>
we whispered our first<br/>
sweet “I love you”s under<br/>
the burning harvest moon.<br/>
Six months later, after we broke up<br/>
and got back together<br/>
she said, “We have fun, right?”<br/>
to cut the long silence of<br/>
our downtown stroll.<br/>
“No.” I thought,<br/>
“I think we do” I said.<br/>
One year later, as we sobbed<br/>
knowing it was over,<br/>
light rain fell from the<br/>
coolly blackened sky,<br/>
washing away our love.<br/>
I drove her home.<br/>
One weekend on a choir trip,<br/>
I met Cara.<br/>
Our love came quicker.<br/>
The night we met was spent<br/>
learning about each other under<br/>
the pin pricks of light in the<br/>
chillingly clear mountain night sky.<br/>
We ritualized Fridays,<br/>
giving them entirely to one another,<br/>
our weekly spikes of love.<br/>
Six months later, I found<br/>
Cara in the corner of my<br/>
little blue bedroom,<br/>
rocking back and forth,<br/>
trying desperately to rid her mind<br/>
of depression and anxiety.<br/>
I frowned and held her.<br/>
One year later, late at night<br/>
Cara and I wandered down to a dock.<br/>
We talked about beauty and<br/>
how far we&#39;d come.<br/>
As rain began to fall,<br/>
we ripped each other&#39;s clothes off.

and your disapproval<br/>
and I scream<br/>
<h1>The Most Feelings I&#39;ve Ever Felt Walking to my 8 AM Poetry Class with Jordan Smith on a Wednesday Morning</h1>
Moonlit morning walk into class<br/>
Groggy students drift to 8 Ams<br/>
Venerable oak, rustling overhead<br/>
Just then<br/>
An acorn falls<br/>
Strikes me square on the head<br/>
Fucking squirrels
