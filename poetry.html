<h1>Everybody Needs a Break Sometimes</h1>
Inspired by this photograph<br/>
<img src="assets/jackiechan.jpg"/>
<br/><br/><br/>
He burns with thought,<br/>
a venerable stone building<br/>
&#9;frames him.<br/><br/>
He’s paid to play pretend<br/>
but the cigarette butts &amp; unkempt street<br/>
&#9;are real now.<br/><br/>
His fight scene<br/>
&#9;had gone wrong.<br/><br/>
He was to dodge the left hook, sweep the leg.<br/>
But the enemy didn’t jump the sweep,<br/>
&#9;&amp; down he went.<br/><br/>
Face met flowery tea cup,<br/>
cutting a thick, deep gash,<br/>
&#9;a spray of blood.<br/><br/>
His enemy knew what should have happened.<br/>
But he did it,<br/>
&#9;he made leg crash into leg.<br/><br/>
The closed eyes, broken face<br/>
&#9;won’t leave him.<br/><br/>
"Jackie, you’re on."
<h1 class="monospace-poem"><b>The Book of the Hacker (Desire)</b></h1>
<div class="monospace">
<i>Live as if you were digital.</i><br/>
Inspired by The Book of the Dead Man by Marvin Bell
<br/><br/><br/>
<b>1. About the Hacker and Desire</b><br/>
The hacker does not know where he finds himself.<br/>
On one of his morning exploits, he sees writing in a foreign tongue that<br/>
reminds him of Russian, but sharper.<br/>
The hacker finds himself in The Ukraine, he stares blankly at his green on<br/>
black terminal; his window into that much larger than him.<br/>
The hacker stands in a river of information.<br/>
He finds an open webcam and sees a newborn baby, eyes twinkling in the light of the LCD.<br/>
The hacker now sits at the top of a financial empire in the heart of Wall Street.<br/>
Now the hacker reads an email about a graphic car crash, picture included.<br/>
He is briefly in the memory banks of the people he intrudes on.<br/>
The hacker wonders how long he will remember his acquaintances.<br/>
An annoying accident finds the hacker at his own server.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<b>2. More About the Hacker and Desire</b><br/>
The hacker has no family, he doesn&#39;t need one.<br/>
He abuses the follies of man and machine.<br/>
The hacker is excited over the idea that his curiosity may be boundless.<br/>
He dons a hat of healthy grey.<br/>
For the hacker, a simple command can ripple out into the physical world.<br/>
To the hacker, the internet is a sticky copper spiderweb.<br/>
To the hacker, data is the oil, the blood, the gold.<br/>
To the hacker, the transistor is the basic unit of life.<br/>
The hacker yearns for dense cityscapes and lively coffee shops.<br/>
The hacker thinks of the shoulders he stands on: Alan Turing, Dennis Ritchie, Ada Lovelace, GeoHot, Solo, C0mrade, TeaMp0isoN and wants others on his.<br/>
The hacker is proud of his shrouded work.<br/>
The hacker has seen technologies come and go just as he has seen people, policies, regimes and parties come and go.

<h1>Chinese Fall</h1>
Inspired by Tomas Tranströmer
<br/><br/><br/>
The rose with a single thorn,<br/>
intentionally untrimmed,<br/>
bites the victim.<br/>
Their wince is candy.<br/><br/>
Shining Chinese gorge, between<br/>
Wu Shan and Ba Dong.<br/>
In the distance,<br/>
a roiling thunderstorm<br/>
narrows its eyes.<br/><br/>
Organ, with endlessly complex pipes,<br/>
smooth ivory keys.<br/>
Hides itself from the listener,<br/>
shows only false, hollow exterior.<br/>
Blares loud, cacophonous Messiaen chords.<br/><br/>
Burs in my brother&#39;s shoes,<br/>
hours of incessant itching<br/>
will show him.<br/>
How dare he<br/>
take my Pokemon cards.<br/><br/>
<h1>This Poem Is Not About Cara</h1>
The whore cries,<br/>
“I&#39;m your little bitch”<br/>
in that whiny, grating,<br/>
“I&#39;m about to fake<br/>
an orgasm” squeal I&#39;ve<br/>
heard a hundred times<br/>
before, but never from<br/>
this side of the<br/>
bedroom door.<br/><br/>
Fuck...<br/>
Fucking Fucking Fuckity Fuck!<br/>
Blinded by tears and screaming<br/>
along at 60 miles an hour,<br/>
I&#39;m going home to my bed.<br/>
For a month, the world had ended.<br/>
It felt like my pores<br/>
oozed black slime.<br/><br/>
I finally let myself go out<br/>
to a bar, and mope at<br/>
anyone that would listen.<br/>
“Hey buddy, that sucks.<br/>
Let me buy you a beer.”<br/>
We talk about our ex girlfriends<br/>
and he knows the feeling all too well.<br/>
The night goes on, and<br/>
I&#39;ve made a friend.
<h1>"Friday I&#39;m in Love"</h1>
is that song from high school<br/>
I never want to hear again and<br/>
Anastasia is the girl who gave it to me.<br/>
Her parents fled cold, careless<br/>
Putin when she was 8.<br/>
Our love came quickly.<br/>
At the choir camp bonfire<br/>
we whispered our first<br/>
sweet “I love you”s under<br/>
the burning harvest moon.<br/>
Six months later, after we broke up<br/>
and got back together<br/>
she said, “We have fun, right?”<br/>
to cut the long silence of<br/>
our downtown stroll.<br/>
“No.” I thought,<br/>
“I think we do” I said.<br/>
One year later, as we sobbed<br/>
knowing it was over,<br/>
light rain fell from the<br/>
coolly blackened sky,<br/>
washing away our love.<br/>
I drove her home.<br/>
One weekend on a choir trip,<br/>
I met Cara.<br/>
Our love came quicker.<br/>
The night we met was spent<br/>
learning about each other under<br/>
the pin pricks of light in the<br/>
chillingly clear mountain night sky.<br/>
We ritualized Fridays,<br/>
giving them entirely to one another,<br/>
our weekly spikes of love.<br/>
Six months later, I found<br/>
Cara in the corner of my<br/>
little blue bedroom,<br/>
rocking back and forth,<br/>
trying desperately to rid her mind<br/>
of depression and anxiety.<br/>
I frowned and held her.<br/>
One year later, late at night<br/>
Cara and I wandered down to a dock.<br/>
We talked about beauty and<br/>
how far we&#39;d come.<br/>
As rain began to fall,<br/>
we ripped each other&#39;s clothes off.

<h1>The Most Feelings I&#39;ve Ever Felt Walking to my 8 AM Poetry Class with Jordan Smith on a Wednesday Morning</h1>
Moonlit morning walk into class<br/>
Groggy students drift to 8 Ams<br/>
Venerable oak, rustling overhead<br/>
Just then<br/>
An acorn falls<br/>
Strikes me square on the head<br/>
Fucking squirrels

Two Toned Teacher <br/>
<br/>
From flea bath wails<br/>
To careful wall bumps<br/>
He made it<br/>
<br/>
Long tail for tugging<br/>
Soft body for plastic bag rides<br/>
Perfect pillow, napping to his purrs<br/>
Stairway thunder for evening attic time <br/>
The smell of stress oozing after a trip to the garage<br/>
Memories of Hazel rearing sister brother Daisy<br/>
Never stretching a claw to play<br/>
Always in his hidey holes<br/>
<br/>
His patience in scooped up loving arms<br/>
knowing it will end soon<br/>
Now once and for all<br/>
<br/>
Rest in peace, Moxie<br/>

Finally, escape<br/>

Taking a drag as I slide down the merry go round of life<br/>
120 feet in the air is high enough for my sister most days, but she, like cats, birds, and Killians, like to be tall<br/>

What?<br/>
<br/>
That hurt?<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
The bar<br/>
<br/>
How can a bar hurt you?<br/>
<br/>
The booze doesn’t help<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, neither does the smoke<br/>
<br/>
Or the reminders or the phantoms or the memories or the past ex-something carving her way into every corner of the psyche that’s too broken for her or anyone<br/>
<br/>
Just Breath, it’s what Treebeard would do<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf would breath something else<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf’s not real<br/>
<br/>
Neither is she<br/>
<br/>
Neither are we<br/>

I think I’m good, actually<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I’m not, but you are, and that’s good<br/>
<br/>
Feeding baby bunnies may make you think you are who you are but you aren’t that person<br/>
<br/>
You’re that other person the one you saw at 10 Forward<br/>
<br/>
The one that wanted so badly for<br/>
A slowly creeping vine to find her way back into your short longer life<br/>
The Ivy Leagues reminding you that maybe a 3.6 isn’t something to be proud of<br/>
<br/>
Things could have been different<br/>
You just have to not take that first breath<br/>
And all the rest are easy<br/>
<h1>It&#x27;s Nice To Share</h1>

<h1>Dear Michigan</h1>
<span class="poem-date">2023-06-19</span><br/>
You held me for 18 years and I abandoned you<br/>
To Schenectady, NY, a city most can’t even spell<br/>
Much less point to on a map<br/>
Or visit<br/>
<br/>
I was wed in Northampton, MA<br/>
<br/>
Michigan didn’t come to my aide then<br/>
<br/>
I was divorce in South Hadley, MA<br/>
<br/>
Now Michigan wants me back<br/>
<br/>
And I know what I want.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t want the responsibility of end of life care for you<br/>
<br/>
I don’t want the responsibility of your house<br/>
<br/>
I don’t want your life<br/>
<br/>
I don’t want your Michigan<br/>
<br/>
I want my<br/>
<br/>
I want my place<br/>
<br/>
I want my home to be my home and not your home and not her home or their home or anyone’s home but my home until my home can be a home for anyone else but for now<br/>
<br/>
My home is my home.<br/>
<br/>
My home is a building.<br/>
<br/>
It’s made a wood and plaster.<br/>
<br/>
It’s in South Hadley, MA, and it is mine.<br/>
<br/>
I point to it and I say<br/>
<br/>
“I want it all to myself”<br/>
<br/>
Until I am ready to share,<br/>
<br/>
And I am not ready to share yet.<br/>
<br/>
I need to take.<br/>
<br/>
I need to eat.<br/>
<br/>
I need to satiate my hungers<br/>
<br/>
Now<br/>
<br/>
And forever.<br/>
<h1>Dear dad</h1>
<span class="poem-date">2023-06-07</span><br/>
You worked too much and I do resent you for it. Now that I’m on the flip-side I know that you were just trying to be better than your dad, who didn’t work hard, had to rely on Grandma, and was an asshole who gave you specific directions to let you know you’re a fuck up and nothing will ever work out for you.<br/>
<br/>
I didn’t luck out when you took that typing course, I lucked out when Someone came to the new world and left the old one behind. I like this new world, I don’t want to be Czech or a French Canadian fur trapper. I like being a Jocque.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mom,<br/>
<br/>
You worked too much on all the wrong things. You never took the time or space for yourself because you let your kids consume you.<br/>
<br/>
We don’t want you, and you know it now, and it sucks because I do like you, I just don’t like your parenting. I don’t think we’d be friends outside of the context of a mother daughter relationship.<br/>

“I’m so glad you’re taking pictures of the garden!”<br/>
It’s a video<br/>
“Ronnie just loved that garden, you know, he had to really reign it in when he hit his 90s. Corn, beans, you name it, Ronnie was giving away the food as fast as he could make it. We’re just the nieces though, that house you know, we had a lot of fun in there crawling around the attic from one bedroom to the next. That place has good karma.”<br/>

Sam’s Video<br/>
Sam’s Video was a video store on Stadium Boulevard in the late 90 to early aughts. On Friday nights, my family would have Pizza and Movie Night. My dad would call up Hello Faz’s Pizza, owned by a guy whose last name was Faz, and passed down to his son, who works there and revamped the place. It’s still kicking. You could go there and order The Bo Schembechler Pizza<br/>

I love hearing the roar of the engine on the dawn air. <br/>

<br/>
Masc is me in my wedding outfit hair up in a bun or maybe in a hat? Could do my sports outfit too <br/>
Or is me in oversized hoodie with a choker short black skirt and thigh highs flashing by for a moment <br/>
Femme is me with hair down in my flowery dress with makeup and lip stain no eye liner but mascara on the femme half of my face <br/>
Masc or femme? <br/>
Then facing the camera wearing all clothes from both outfits <br/>
