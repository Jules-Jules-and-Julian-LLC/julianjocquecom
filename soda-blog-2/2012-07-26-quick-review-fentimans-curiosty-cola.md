Fentimans Curiosity Cola at first sounds like it will be nothing more
than a strange novelty. However, it is much much more than that.
Boasting the most unique bottling I have ever seen and with a delicious
flavor to match Fentiman's Curiosity Cola is a must have soda. I adored
every moment I had with it, from first looking at the bottling to the
last drop I desperately shook in to my mouth, praying for more. I highly
recommend it both as a soda to be enjoyed on your own and as a soda to
be shared at a party. Friends would enjoy the new, gingery twist on the
classic Cola. The flavor is the best Cola you have ever had, with a new
layer of ginger added in. The ginger is present but not overpowering at
all and adds immensely to the overall experience.  
  
Fantastic soda, do try it if you get the chance. It is available for
purchase in World Market stores across the US and online at various
retailers.
