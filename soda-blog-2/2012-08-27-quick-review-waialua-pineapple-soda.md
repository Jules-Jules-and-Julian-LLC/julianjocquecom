Waialua Pineapple Soda is a soda with great intentions that built up to
be pretty good but fell flat in a lot of respects. First off, before you
even open the bottle you can see that the bottle itself is completely
generic. The labeling is equally bland, the fonts are pretty
uninteresting and the logo is just generically Hawaiian. The soda itself
is pretty boring too. The flavor isn't that strong but the carbonation
is good. It includes Maui White Cane Sugar in its ingredients which is
cool but the flavor is just not nearly strong enough. The company is
actually based in Hawaii as well which is sorta cool. These minor
coolnesses just don't make up for a low quality soda though. Don't go
out of your way for this one.
