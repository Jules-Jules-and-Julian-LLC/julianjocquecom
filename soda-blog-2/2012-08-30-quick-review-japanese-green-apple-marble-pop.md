I'm not sure the name of this soda because it is in Japanese. I got in
an Asian food market in Boston, so you could look there I suppose. This
soda is absolutely fantastic. The marble gimmick is super fun to play
with and as a standalone soda it is absolutely wonderful. The flavor is
very subtle and mostly defined by the citric acid. It's also healthy to
boot! It has only 10 grams of sugar, 4 milligrams of sodium and 60
calories. I personally think it would go amazingly with a lunch,
especially one featuring fruits.  
If you happen upon this soda buy it on sight, it is really great
although it will be pretty difficult to find.
