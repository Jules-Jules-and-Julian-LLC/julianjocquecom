*Background:* During this past school year I went on a trip to the
Boston Aquarium. It was purely for fun and after we finished up at the
Aquarium we were allowed to wander the city as we pleased. My friends
and I decided to just walk around and go down any street that looked
interesting. We looked down a long street and saw a giant Asian gate. It
looked cool so we went in and found ourselves suddenly plunged in to
China Town. We went in to an Asian food market and I found all sorts of
neat sodas. I got this one for $1.39 and I have no idea where you could
find it or what its name is. So let's continue our streak of extremely
legit foreign sodas!

Bottling: The bottling is of course really cool. The whole marble pop
gimmick is really fun and makes for a nice piece to put on a shelf after
you are done. The interesting bits of this bottling is that for one it
has some cool ribbing in the skinny part of the bottle. Very different
from the other variations I have seen. The other awesome part is that
absolutely everything is written in Japanese! It makes this a really
unique find, I would definitely have trouble getting this anywhere but
an Asian food market. Even the nutrition facts had to have an English
sticker put over it to meet FDA requirements.

makes it kind of hard for me to judge the font and logo. It's just
really super Japanesey. It obviously has Japanese written all over it
but it also has cute Anime-esque green apples will adorable little
faces. One part of the writing that I quite like is the cool symbol put
at the lip of the bottle.

Nutrition facts are pretty interesting, only 10 grams of sugar! Most
sodas are in the 35-40 range so this is going to not be very sweet at
all. Additionally it has only 4mg of sodium and 60 calories. It's really
quite healthy for you! I'm guessing almost all of the flavor will be
coming from the citric acid. The other ingredients are pretty odd as
well. It uses sugar and glucose to sweeten it, I don't think I've ever
encountered glucose before in a soda so this should be pretty
interesting.

I popped the marble in and immediately tragedy struck. The soda really
just exploded everywhere, it got *all* over my keyboard and basically
made my entire desk a sticky mess. I had to pour water all over my $115
mechanical keyboard to save it from being a sticky mess and now it needs
a day or so to dry out. So I'm typing this from a crappy Dell keyboard,
with my keyboard wrapped in a towel behind me. Be strong, buddy!  
  
The only difference I did this time was use the fleshy part of my thumb
to push the marble in. I think this made it hit with greater force than
the it created a seal on the top. This created a ton of pressure to
build up in an extremely short amount of time, causing the explosion. I
highly recommend you use the end of your thumb when pushing the marble
in and do it over something you don't care about, like a sink or a
counter top.  
  
But the review must go on! I won't be judging the carbonation too
harshly because the soda has been sitting out for a while now.

Oh how utterly delightful! Wow, this is an absolutely amazingly subtle
yet present flavor. It really does taste like green apple but it is not
over powering at all. This is honestly one of the best flavors I have
had in a very long time. It is so perfectly fruity without being over
the top. The problem that most fruit sodas run in to is they start
tasting like liquefied lollipops. This has very little sugar so the
sweetness is not over powering and it really lets the appley flavor come
through. It really does taste genuinely like taking a bite right in to a
green apple.  
  
Carbonation is not bad at all, the faster you chug the more carbonation
you get because of the way the marble creates carbonation. The spout is
a bit awkward to drink from, it's just really small so it feels strange
to not fully wrap my lips around it. I also don't like the fact that the
lip is made of plastic. I can understand why it has to be that way
though. The carbonation is definitely much stronger than on the
Americanized version that I had last time. This is definitely a good
thing.  
  
The amazing subtlety and simplicity of this flavor is awesome. It
reminds me a lot of Cas Cal in that it is a nice, calm flavor that would
go great with a fruit salad or really a lunch of any kind. I think the
way that the sweetened it and the fact that it is high on Citric acid is
what really made it so amazingly subtle.

One big downside is that there is not much liquid in here. I have taken
maybe 4 or 5 sips and it's basically all gone already. I would love to
see some bigger bottles of this, though that is most likely just due to
me being an American and being used to the hugely gigantic cans we get
over here. Ohhh the weird indentations on one side of the bottle make
sense now. When you are low on soda tipping the bottle up can make the
marble fall in to the cap, causing the cap to get blocked and stopping
the flow of soda in to your mouth. The indentations hold the marble in
place and stop this. Very clever!

**Overall,** this is just a really nice tasting soda. The flavor is very
well done and it is not overpowering at all. If you somehow happen to
get a chance to try this out you definitely should. It tastes great and
it's not bad for you. I would recommend this as a gimmick to hand around
at a party, or to be had with an afternoon meal or even just to be hand
on its own. It's just simply an awesome soda, I highly recommend it.
