I sort of regret not posting this sooner because to be perfectly blunt I
haven't been keeping up with the comments section on this site. I really
didn't know anybody at all went here until I checked my Google Analytics
a few days ago. One fellow by the name of Ricky posted on my Open Cola
post discussing how much soda it made and he referenced his own blog. I
was shocked to find an absolutely fantastic blog on brewing all sorts of
your own soda. I'll definitely be frequenting there and trying out some
of the recipes around Thanksgiving (college soon, won't be able to get
any resources).  
  
Thanks Ricky for the comment, here's the link to the blog
