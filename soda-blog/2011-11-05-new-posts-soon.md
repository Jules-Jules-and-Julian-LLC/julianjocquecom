Hey there, I'm still at college. It has been a damned fun time and I can
comfortably say that I am making the most of it in my first term. My
winter break starts fairly soon so I will obviously be doing reviews
when I am back home but I have even better news. I expected there to be
no good soda but I was totally wrong. At the book store I was able to
get some Jone's soda and at the Starbucks I picked up some Izze. The
Izze Clementine soda review is done at the moment, just needs to be
prettied up a bit. My friend who is from Schenectady also said that
there is a store I could go to that has all sorts of great sodas so
hopefully I will be able to stop by there sometime.  
  
There is also the matter of some old notes I have that never got
finalized. For 2-3 sodas I drank them, wrote up notes and saved them as
a draft on the blog but never put the actual post together. I have stuff
going all the way back to January that I totally forgot about! So I'm
going to finalize those posts and get them up, they will be light on
pictures though because I don't have the bottling on me(they are at home
in my empty bottle collection).  
  
So that's some good news, I'm really glad that I get to keep writing
from school!
