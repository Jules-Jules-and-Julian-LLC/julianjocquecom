What if you could join a worldwide community of soda lovers like you?
What if by joining that community you could help to document sodas,
helping history by saving these sodas forever, helping others to decide
what they want to try(or not!) by giving your opinions on the sodas you
drink and love. What if you could even  trade sodas with anyone in the
world to give the gift of your favorite soda and receive an exotic new
sodas? What if all of this was totally free to do on a not for profit
website? Then [Dizzy Frinks](http://dizzyfrinks.com/) is there for you.

  

A website where you can review sodas already on the site, submit sodas
that aren't there already or just browse and get new ideas for what to
try out. I know that I am personally having fun going through the "most
popular" sodas and seeing which ones I have tried and getting ideas for
how to get every other one that I haven't. I'm definitely going to be
participating in the soda trading as well soon enough. I imagine there
are some really cool sodas over in other continents that I would
otherwise not have a chance at getting.

  

I definitely highly recommend this site if you are any sort of soda fan!
Hope to see all of your reviews showing up there soon!
