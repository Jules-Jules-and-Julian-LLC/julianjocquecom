Sorry for my absence, school takes precedence over this. I'm out of
school now though so it's time for a lovely summer of soda! I'm excited
to do plenty of reviews in these coming 2 months.

**Background:** <span style="background-color: white;">This soda is
quite dear to my heart. Over this previous Winter Break I picked up a
seasonal job at a mail order company. The company was really super
awesome and when I went in to pick up my last pay check, there was a $25
gift card to a
local </span><span style="background-color: white;">restaurant</span><span style="background-color: white;">.
I didn't get to use the coupon because I had to go back to school, but
when my parents used it they picked up this soda for me. I've never
heard of Blenheim so this is quite exciting for me to get a really nice
soda for free out of the blue! This is also the only Ginger Ale I have
ever had besides Vernor's. I'm looking forward to seeing what a true
Ginger Ale is like and seeing if it has that same nose-burning quality
that Vernor's has.</span>

I did some research on Bleinheim and they pride themselves on being old
fashioned. The bottling company was founded in 1903, so this seems
totally legitimate. They also say they bottle in 3 "flavors", they
indicate these flavors only by the color of the cap which is pretty
cool. Red means strong, Gold means mild and White means diet. I got Red,
which I quite like as it will be a true Ginger Ale!  
  
  
Bottling is really quite standard. It sort of reminds me of a Boylan's
but not as thick and strong. It has a somewhat slender feeling overall
which is pretty appropriate for a Ginger Ale. I suppose I have trouble
placing exactly what a Ginger Ale bottle should look like. For a Root
Beer it makes total sense to be all dense and heavy, for Cas Cal it made
perfect sense to be all whispy and elegant. Ginger Ale doesn't have a
specific "feel" to it though, so I suppose that is why they went for
generic.

The logo is **super** cool but also quite confusing. It has the same
patriotic bird that appears on the seal of the United States. It has the
arrows in one talon and ivy in the other. Instead of having E. Pluribus
Unum though it has "Original Ginger Ale". Very odd, but I like it just
for the design, ignoring all the other connotations. I quite like the
font, it is clearly indicating that the soda is pretty old and venerable
which makes sense from their other marketing. The "G" of Ginger Ale is
pretty hard to read so that should probably be changed, but besides that
the typography is nice. I really like how "from pure water" is hollow
lettering, it really lends a pure feeling to the text. It also says "No
Refills" which I find pretty cute, like a little throw back to the days
of old when you could go to the pharmacy and get one bottle refilled.

Ingredients are totally what one would expect. Not too many of them, but
probably all the interesting bits are hidden in whatever "Natural
Flavorings" is. Nutrition facts are also as expected. 170 calories, 41
grams of sugar. Maybe a little bit sugar heavy, but not ridiculous by
any means.

Lastly, we have sediment! Yes, the one true mark of a genuine soda that
is legitimately not just syrup+carbonated water. This is almost
certainly a byproduct of their old fashioned creation process. The only
other time I have had this was the Cas Cal and that did not
disappoint.  
  

<span style="color: orange; font-size: x-large;">During Drinking</span>

Pop top! I've said it in the past but I think these are pretty unneeded.
They don't keep a better seal and they are just inconvenient since you
need a tool to get the top off. Nice little psssssst as it came off, not
much of a pop.  
  
First sip and I liked it at first but after a bit it
becomes <span style="font-size: large;">**so** </span>strong! I still
have a burn in my mouth. This stuff is **not** messing around at all. I
really can't emphasize enough that this is overpowering. Hopefully by
the bottom I'll be more used to it and more able to judge the flavor.
Took a much smaller sip and it was a lot better. Unless you are a ginger
fanatic and love the punch to the face you should take this slowly. Tons
of carbonation makes me feel it in my nose. It seems Ginger Ales really
like to have a lot of carbonation. Just had a really super long and
drawn out burp, that was awesome.  
  
Okay I am quite a bit more used to it, that initial "punch you straight
in the mouth and throat" feeling is mostly gone. I am really conflicted
on this soda. I must admit that I flat out don't like it but that is not
at all because it is a bad soda or because it is poorly made, it is
entirely my own preferences. I just simply don't like ginger enough to
want to drink what is basically liquefied ginger.  
  
The soda leaves a persisting burn in your throat. It's not terrible,
just kind of uncomfortable.  
Okay now that it has thoroughly burned my taste buds off it is pretty
sweet. I'm about 1/3 of the way through and it now is tasting much more
like just a soda with a ginger flavor. Now the only part I don't like
are the burps, they burn pretty badly.  
  
Just gave a sip of it to my sister after warning her it was strong, she
made a funny face and then put it quite well "That was weird and really
strong but I think I might want more. It's sort of like eating spicy
food, when you have it you're like 'waaah' but then you kind of want to
keep going." I really do think that puts it perfectly, it's super
overpowering at first but as you get used to it you can actually get the
flavor and it's really nice. I just don't like ginger that much and she
does so she was more interested in drinking more than me.  
Usually with every tasting of a soda I always do a chug of it where I'll
take 2-3 gulps in a row, but with this I think I will pass. It would
just burn too much.  
  
As I go through the remainder it is more of the same. The flavor is just
a very strong ginger flavor with a lot of initial sweetness. When you
first introduce it in to your mouth it is always sweet then the ginger
punches you immediately after that.  
  

<span style="color: blue; font-size: x-large;">After Drinking</span>

This is bar-none the most interesting soda I have ever had. It has me
more conflicted than anything. First off, this is not a party soda at
all, this is a soda that you would get as a single and drink as a
novelty, sharing it with others so they can see how weird it is. I would
never get a 6 pack of these and then drink it with a meal.  
This is quite simply a soda made for the curious and made for the ginger
lovers of the world. If you have had ginger ale in the past and really
loved it, this would be super awesome to try out and it would give you a
whole new perspective. If you just want a weird soda to show off and
maybe share around with people, this is awesome for that as well. This
really, really does not fit in with the categories of any soda I have
ever had before. I am really glad I got to try this, as it truly is a
new discovery for me and that is a cool thing to have.  
  
Overall, buy a single, try it out, share it with others just for the
experience. This isn't a soda to drink, this is a soda to experience.  
  
I also gave it to my parents, my dad who usually does really well with
strong flavors took a sip, made a face and started fanning his tongue.
My mom had a similar reaction to my sister, didn't say much then flatly
said "It's hot, but I like it. You could add club soda!" Definitely a
great novelty for sharing!
