**Background: **<span style="background-color: white;">This is one that
I am quite excited about, I have heard good things about it online and I
have had it sitting in my collection for about a year now! Perhaps it
will have a nice aged flavor to it. I got it at World Market for $1.79.
I highly recommend stopping by World Market if you want some nice
bottled sodas. 5 or 6 of the sodas in my collection are from
there.</span>

Most unique bottling I have seen, bar none. The neck has a really
interesting shape to it and the bottom is flat with a slight bubble
going around it. Very interesting, I don't see it as really conveying
any particular image. With a Boylan's bottle it is obvious that they are
trying to have a strong, bold feel to their soda. Fentimans seems to go
for the "Curiosity" part of their name, just making their bottle a
little bit strange. It doesn't feel heavy or slender or average, it's
just different. Very unique and really drives the branding.

The logo is nice, the illustration of the dog has a very old-timey feel
to it. I adore the font, totally feels like the old sodas of the past.
The font makes it seem like the sort of soda that you would pick up from
the apothecary for a nickel. It also boasts about being "Botanically
Brewed" which is probably more a marketing term than anything else. All
that seems to mean is that they include ginger and herbs in the soda. I
am quite looking forward to that, very strange combination of cola,
herbs and ginger that I haven't seen before. The cap is also completely
blank of any ink. I sort of like that, a nice simple look though it
isn't anything terribly special.  
  
It is also a bit darker of a cola than most. Even a bright light only
shines through the neck of the bottle, the body is all pure dark.

of sugar and calories are perfectly average. The ingredients are
definitely odd though, the first ingredient is water followed by
carbonated water. Every other soda I have *ever* had was carbonated
water only as the top ingredient. This means that it will probably not
be as bubbly as most sodas I am used to. It also lists ginger and
caffeine as ingredients. I am really interested to see what ginger in
cola tastes like, never had that before. I am also very glad that they
included caffeine on their list of ingredients. Very often a soda will
have caffeine in it but not list it anywhere on the can. When I was a
kid this annoyed me greatly because I wasn't allowed to have soda with
caffeine in it. It is also made with real sugar, but that is completely
unsurprising. Basically par for the course with sodas I am interested
in.

Twist top which I am glad for, makes a nice "pop!" when I take the cap
off. The ginger is really quite apparent and lends an extremely unique
flavor. The bottle is also not as filled as most are so it takes longer
than expected to get the first taste. The lip is wider than usual as
well which gives a very different feel to is. The glass is also quite
thin right at the lip, which I enjoy. It matches the character of the
soda.

Very good level of carbonation, exactly on par with what it should be. I
would say it is a little bit heavier on the carbonation than a Coca Cola
but a bit lighter than a Henry Weinhard Root Beer.  
  
As far as flavor goes I would describe it as nothing more than the best
cola flavor you've ever had, with ginger mixed in to it. When I had my
first taste the ginger was quite powerful, the most noticeable part of
the soda but now that I am about a quarter done it is much more mild and
nothing more than a wonderful hint layered on top of an amazing cola
flavor.  
  
I am having trouble picking out the other herbs used. I suspect there is
a bit of vanilla extract, because the soda is quite smooth.  
  
Getting lots of good burps out of it too. The carbonation isn't too much
that it feels uncomfortable in the stomach but there is enough of it
that it leads to good quality burps.  
  
Tongue goes a bit numb from the ginger, a little bit of a weird feeling
but totally to be expected.  
  

<span style="color: blue; font-size: x-large;">After Drinking</span>

This soda is just flat out really good. I initially thought that it
would be a novelty but it is just simply a new flavor that hasn't been
done before but which is really quite amazing. The ginger doesn't take
anything away from the Cola flavor, it merely adds on a new layer of
complexity that is very yummy. <span style="background-color: white;">I
think this is one of the few sodas I have had where I want to get a
6-pack of it. This is the sort of soda that if you served it at a party
you would want to point out the uniqueness of it to guests and everyone
would appreciate it. Everyone loves Cola, everyone has had a Coca Cola
and this would be a cool way to introduce them to something new, unique
and utterly delicious.</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">  
</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">I'm not sure I would like having
this with a meal though. It is a complex enough flavor on its own that I
think it would distract from a meal rather than add to it. Unless you
considered it as being a side-dish to the meal instead of just a liquid
to wash the meal down with.</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">  
</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">Overall, I highly recommend it to
anyone who likes soda at all. It is a new twist on a classic flavor that
is completely unique to anything I have had before and it tastes
amazing.</span>
