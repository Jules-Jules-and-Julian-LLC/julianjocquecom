<h1>One-off Little Toys</h1>
<h2><a href="toys/cursors/cursors.html">Cursors That Are Cool</a></h2>
<p>Some of my earliest programming/digital art creation was in Adobe Flash. I remember strongly finding a tutorial on how to make custom cursors.
  I had so much fun coming up with different effects and styles, especially this Chinese dragon chasing cursor.
  This is a modern implementation of my early inspiration, I think it's a lot of fun to play with!</p>

<p>I love the culture surrounding programming, and recreating snake is one of those "rites of passage" I found I hadn't checked off the bucket list.
  That made for a good excuse to dust off my processing expertise, I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM">this tutorial</a> then added my own personality.
